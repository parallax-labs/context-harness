# Context Harness

> Context Harness is an open-source, local-first context engine for AI tools. It ingests documents and knowledge from any source, indexes them in a local SQLite database with FTS5 and vector embeddings, and exposes hybrid search (keyword + semantic) via a CLI and MCP-compatible HTTP server. Built in Rust by Parallax Labs. MIT licensed.

Context Harness solves the problem of giving AI agents (Cursor, Claude, custom agents) access to your project's documentation, code, runbooks, and knowledge — without sending data to the cloud. It runs as a single binary (`ctx`) that syncs content from filesystem, Git, S3, or custom Lua connectors, chunks it intelligently, and serves it to any MCP-compatible tool.

## Key Capabilities

- **Extension registry**: install community connectors for Jira, Confluence, Slack, RSS, and more from Git-backed registries
- **Connector-driven ingestion**: filesystem, Git, S3, and custom Lua scripts
- **Local-first storage**: SQLite with WAL mode, FTS5 full-text search, vector embeddings
- **Hybrid search**: BM25 keyword scoring + cosine semantic scoring with configurable alpha blending
- **MCP server**: Streamable HTTP endpoint for Cursor, Claude Desktop, and any MCP-compatible agent
- **Lua extensibility**: custom connectors and agent tools without recompiling Rust
- **CLI-first**: Unix-composable `ctx` commands for init, sync, search, serve, and more
- **Offline-first RAG**: pre-build search indexes at build time, ship as static assets
